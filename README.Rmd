### Title 

Exploring Global Patterns of Obesity from 1985 to 2017

Body Mass Index (BMI) is often used a proxy for adiposity with classifications based on BMI to define "underweight", "normal", "overweight" and "obese", where higher BMI has been associated with increased mortality, rates of type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and stroke. 
A recent [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1171-x.pdf) showed that contrary to a widely reported view (that urbanization is one of the most important drivers in the global rise of obesity), in fact BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas (compared to cities), in particular in low- and middle-income regions. 
Also, there a gender-discrepancy (women have a higher BMI in rural communities).
Here, we explore this data to understand global patters in obesity. 
This analysis is important because it demonstrates the need to provide better access (financial and physical access) to healthy foods in rural communities, especially in low-income countries to address the obesity crisis. 

### Motivating questions

1. Is there a difference between rural and urban BMI estimates around the world? In particular, how does this look for females?
2. How have BMI estimates changed from 1985 to 2017? Again, In particular, how does this look for females?
3. How do different countries compare for BMI estimates? In particular, how does the United States compare to the rest of the world?
