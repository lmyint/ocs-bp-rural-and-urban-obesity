### Disclaimer 

The purpose of the [Open Case Studies](https://opencasestudies.github.io) project is **to demonstrate the use of various data science methods, tools, and software in the context of messy, real-world data**. A given case study does not cover all aspects of the research process, is not claiming to be the most approrpriate way to analyze a given dataset, and should not be used in the context of making policy decisions without external consultation from scientific experts.

### Title 

Exploring Global Patterns of Obesity from 1985 to 2017

Body Mass Index (BMI) is often used a proxy for adiposity with classifications based on BMI to define "underweight", "normal", "overweight" and "obese", where higher BMI has been associated with increased mortality, rates of type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and stroke. 
A recent [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1171-x.pdf) showed that contrary to a widely reported view (that urbanization is one of the most important drivers in the global rise of obesity), in fact BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas (compared to cities), in particular in low- and middle-income regions. 
Also, there a gender-discrepancy (women have a higher BMI in rural communities).
Here, we explore this data to understand global patters in obesity. 
This analysis is important because it demonstrates the need to provide better access (financial and physical access) to healthy foods in rural communities, especially in low-income countries to address the obesity crisis. 

### Motivating questions

1. Is there a difference between rural and urban BMI estimates around the world? In particular, how does this look for females?
2. How have BMI estimates changed from 1985 to 2017? Again, In particular, how does this look for females?
3. How do different countries compare for BMI estimates? In particular, how does the United States compare to the rest of the world?


### Data

The data used in this analysis comes from a [supplementary table](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-019-1171-x/MediaObjects/41586_2019_1171_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) for an article published by  the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration:

### Analysis 

In this case study, we will largly focus on methods for comparing two groups using hypothesis testing and parametric and nonparametric tests. We also cover multiple testing correction and fairly advanced data visualization methods using ggplot2.

#### Data Import 

Data is imported from a PDF using pdftools.
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/carriewright/Documents/GitHub/ocs-rural-and-urban-obesity/logo.png")
```

#### Data wrangling 

This case study covers many wrangling techniques and largely involves using the package stringr. 

1) Dividing data into separate lines
2) Removing excess white-space
3) Removing redundant header information
4) Correcting spacing issues
5) Dealing with NA values that are labeled in an unusal manner
6) Splitting the data into columns using a delimiter
7) Changing variable names
8) Sorting the data
9) Converting to long format
10) Separating a column into multiple columns


#### Data exploration (exploratory analysis)   

To explore the data we use the summarize() function and plot the data to look at the distribution of the data. Quantile-Quantile plots are used to evaluate the distribution and compare it to theoretical normal distribution.

#### Summary

This case study covers fundamental concepts in statistics such as type 1 error, alpha threshold, p-values, hypothesis testing, parametric two sample mean tests, and nonparametric two sample tests, as well as the assumptions of the various included statistical tests and what to do when data is paired.
